MegaMania Engine is a fork of [the Mega Engine made by Wrecking Programs](https://sprites-inc.co.uk/thread-1648.html), which mainly adds multiplayer functionality.

The main goal of this repository is to try and make the best megaman engine for GameMaker Studio 2 users, as GameMaker 1.4 is slower and outdated (for example, awful IDE, outdated usage of DX9 and lack of new functions)

I've decided to discontinue this project as i'm busy with other important stuff. anyone is welcome to fork or update this repo.
